This mobile application serves as a digital photo journal of a significant journey to Bali. It boasts a streamlined, user-oriented interface that facilitates seamless navigation between various screens.

The core screen, the Gallery, presents a curated collection of images from the trip. Each photo is displayed with a thumbnail and a descriptive caption. Selecting an image redirects the user to the Picture Viewing screen, where the chosen image can be viewed in its full dimensions.

Additionally, the application provides a Profile screen where users can view and edit their profile information. This section encompasses numerous fields and user interface components. Any modifications made to the profile are stored locally, ensuring data privacy.

The design and functionality of this application reflect a comprehensive understanding of advanced user interface features in mobile application development. Through the effective implementation of custom components, multi-screen navigation, third-party user interface frameworks such as React Native Paper, and local data storage, a robust and engaging user experience has been successfully achieved.
