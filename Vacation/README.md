The mobile application presented here is a digital photo journal with pictures from my trip to Bali. It allows for the user to navigate between different screens seamlessly and store their profile locally.

The Gallery, which is the main screen of the app, showcases 4 images from the trip. Each image is accompanied by a thumbnail, providing context to the respective photo. On selecting an image, the user is brought to a Picture Viewing screen, where they can view the selected image in its full dimensions and a caption that tells us more about the photo.

The application also has a Profile screen, which provides a space for users to view and modify their profile information. Any changes made to the profile are saved locally.

Theres a use of custom components, multi-screen navigation, third-party user interface frameworks (like React Native Paper), and local data storage.
