Design and Purpose: The Fitness Tracker app is a mobile application designed for tracking personal running exercises. It is intended for individuals who want to keep track of their runs, including date, distance, and time. This will help them compare their times, set goals, and reach them in the future.

Basic Use: The app offers a straightforward and user-friendly interface. To add a run, the user needs to enter the date in the MM-DD-YYYY format, the distance in miles, and the time in the 00:00 format, then press the "Add Run" button. The app stores each run in a list that the user can view anytime. To delete a run, the user should press the "Delete Run" button associated with each run and confirm it in the popup if following through with deleting it.

Screenshots: Three screenshots highlighting the interface and functionality of the FitnessTracker app are available below.
